## Viewing a Repositories History

If we want to know what we've done recently,
we can ask Git to show us the project's history using `git log`:

```bash
$ git log
```

```output
commit cdb7fa654c3f5aee731a655e57f2ba74d9c74582 (HEAD -> forecast)
Author: Joanne Simpson <j.simpson@mo-weather.uk>
Date:   Mon Nov 4 18:35:21 2024 +0000

    Add in the temperature to the forecast and create the weather atlas file
```

`git log` lists all commits  made to a repository in reverse chronological order.
The listing for each commit includes
the commit's full identifier
(which starts with the same characters as
the short identifier printed by the `git commit` command earlier),
the commit's author,
when it was created,
and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.
The output above only shows the latest commit in the log for brevity,
you should see all your commits!
Your log output may be different from what's shown above
depending on whether you completed the challenges
in earlier episodes.

### FCM Comparison

`git log` is equivalent to:

```bash
$ fcm log
```

## Paging the Log

When the output of `git log` is too long to fit in your screen,
`git` uses a program to split it into pages of the size of your screen.
When this "pager" is called, you will notice that the last line in your
screen is a `:`, instead of your usual prompt.

- To get out of the pager, press <kbd>Q</kbd>.
- To move to the next page, press <kbd>Spacebar</kbd>.
- To search for `some_word` in all pages,
  press <kbd>/</kbd>
  and type `some_word`.
  Navigate through matches pressing <kbd>N</kbd>.

## Limit Log Size

To avoid having `git log` cover your entire terminal screen, you can limit the
number of commits that Git lists by using `-N`, where `N` is the number of
commits that you want to view. For example, if you only want information from
the last commit you can use:

```bash
$ git log -1
```

```output
commit cdb7fa654c3f5aee731a655e57f2ba74d9c74582 (HEAD -> forecast)
Author: Joanne Simpson <j.simpson@mo-weather.uk>
Date:   Mon Nov 4 18:35:21 2024 +0000

    Add in the temperature to the forecast and create the weather atlas file
```

You can also reduce the quantity of information using the
`--oneline` option:

```bash
$ git log --oneline
```

```output
cdb7fa6 (HEAD -> forecast) Add in the temperature to the forecast and create the weather atlas file
62a9457 Modify the forecast to add a chance of Sun
d3e4637 Add tomorrows forecast to forecast.md
590c40c Create a md file with the forecast
```

You can also combine the `--oneline` option with others. One useful
combination adds `--graph` to display the commit history as a text-based
graph and to indicate which commits are associated with the
current `HEAD`, the current branch `main`, or
[other Git references][git-references]:

```bash
$ git log --oneline --graph
```

```output
* cdb7fa6 (HEAD -> forecast) Add in the temperature to the forecast and create the weather atlas file
* 62a9457 Modify the forecast to add a chance of Sun
* d3e4637 Add tomorrows forecast to forecast.md
* 590c40c Create a md file with the forecast
```

### A common alias for git log

It is often useful to use the `--decorate`, `--oneline`, and `--graph`
flags all at once.
To avoid us having to write out the three flags each time we can set an alias:

```bash
$ git config --global alias.dog "log --decorate --oneline --graph"
```

This alias makes these two commands equivalent:

```bash
$ git dog
$ git log --decorate --oneline --graph
```

`--decorate` ensures commits with reference names[^refs] are displayed
when using older versions of Git.

[^refs]: [References](https://git-scm.com/book/ms/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References)
in Git are user friendly links to specific commits.
For instance `HEAD` is a reference to the latest commit on a branch.
Programs with regular releases might add reference tags such as `v1.0`
to a specific commit to mark a new release.
These references can be used instead of a commit identifier such as `e48heu0`.

### `git show`

The `git show` command lets you view information for specific commits.
By default `git show` will show information for the latest commit
on the current branch.

```bash
$ git show
```

```output
commit cdb7fa654c3f5aee731a655e57f2ba74d9c74582 (HEAD -> forecast)

## Identifying Commits

As we saw in the previous episode, we can refer to commits by their
identifiers.  You can refer to the *most recent commit* of the working
directory by using the reference name `HEAD`.

We've been adding small changes at a time to `forecast.md`, so it's easy to track our
progress by looking, so let's do that using our `HEAD`s.  Before we start,
let's make a change to `forecast.md`, adding yet another line with
**an ill-considered change**.

```bash
$ nano forecast.md
$ cat forecast.md
```

```output
# Forecast

## Today

Cloudy with a chance of sun.
Mild temperatures around 16 °C.

## Tomorrow

Morning rainbows followed by light showers.
An ill-considered change.
```

Now, let's see what we get.

```bash
$ git diff HEAD forecast.md
```

```output
diff --git a/forecast.md b/forecast.md
index b36abfd..0848c8d 100644
--- a/forecast.md
+++ b/forecast.md
@@ -8,3 +8,4 @@
 Mild temperatures around 16 °C.
 
 ## Tomorrow
 
 Morning rainbows followed by light showers.
+An ill-considered change.
```

which is the same as what you would get if you leave out `HEAD` (try it).  The
real goodness in all this is when you can refer to previous commits.  We do
that by adding `~1`
(where "~" is "tilde", pronounced [**til**\-d*uh*])
to refer to the commit one before `HEAD`.

```bash
$ git diff HEAD~1 forecast.md
```

If we want to see the differences between older commits we can use `git diff`
again, but with the notation `HEAD~1`, `HEAD~2`, and so on, to refer to them:

```bash
$ git diff HEAD~2 forecast.md
```

```output
diff --git a/forecast.md b/forecast.md

We can also use identifiers with `git show`.

```

In this way,
we can build up a chain of commits.
The most recent end of the chain is referred to as `HEAD`;
we can refer to previous commits using the `~` notation,
so `HEAD~1`
means "the previous commit",
while `HEAD~123` goes back 123 commits from where we are now.

We can also refer to commits using
those long strings of digits and letters
that both `git log` and `git show` display.
These are unique IDs for the changes,
and "unique" really does mean unique:
every change to any set of files on any computer
has a unique 40-character identifier.
Our first commit on the `forecast` branch was given the ID
`f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b`,
so let's try this:

```bash
$ git diff f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b forecast.md
```

```output
diff --git a/forecast.md b/forecast.md

```

That's the right answer,
but typing out random 40-character strings is annoying,
so Git lets us use just the first few characters (typically seven for normal size projects):

```bash
$ git diff f22b25e forecast.md
```

diff --git a/forecast.md b/forecast.md
index df0654a..93a3e13 100644

So far we have only been comparing a previous commit to the working copy.
To get a difference between two specific commits use both their IDs:

## Understanding Workflow and History

What is the output of the last command in

```bash
$ cd weather
$ git switch -c add_CMIP_data
$ echo "Global Climate Data" > CMIP7.md
$ git add CMIP7.md
$ echo "Data from the 7th model intercomparison project" >> CMIP7.md
$ git commit -m "Adds in CMIP7 data file"
$ git restore CMIP7.md
$ cat CMIP7.md  # this will print the content of CMIP7.md on screen
```

1. ```output
  Data from the 7th model intercomparison project
  ```
2. ```output
  Global Climate Data
  ```
3. ```output
  Global Climate Data
  Data from the 7th model intercomparison project
  ```
4. ```output
  Error because you have changed CMIP7.md without committing the changes
  ```

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

The answer is 2.

The changes to the file from the second `echo` command are only applied to the working copy,
not the version in the staging area.

So, when `git commit -m "Adds in CMIP7 data file"` is executed,
the version of `CMIP7.md` committed to the repository is the one from the staging area and
only has one line, `Global Climate Data`.

At this time, the working copy still has the second line (and
`git status` will show that the file is modified).
However, `git restore CMIP7.md`
removes all unstaged modifications to the `CMIP7.md` file, so the second line is removed.
So, `cat CMIP7.md` will output

```output
Global Climate Data
```

## Checking Understanding of `git diff`

Consider this command: `git diff HEAD~9 forecast.md`. What do you predict this command
will do if you execute it? What happens when you do execute it? Why?

Try another command, `git diff [ID] forecast.md`, where [ID] is replaced with
the unique identifier for your most recent commit. What do you think will happen,
and what does happen?

## Explore and Summarize Histories

Exploring history is an important part of Git, and often it is a challenge to find
the right commit ID, especially if the commit is from several months ago.

Imagine the `weather` project has more than 50 files.
You would like to find a commit that modifies some specific text in `forecast.md`.
When you type `git log`, a very long list appeared.
How can you narrow down the search?

Recall that the `git diff` command allows us to explore one specific file,
e.g., `git diff forecast.md`. We can apply a similar idea here.

```bash
$ git log forecast.md
```

Unfortunately some of these commit messages are very ambiguous, e.g., `update files`.
How can you search through these files?

Both `git diff` and `git log` are very useful and they summarize a different part of the history
for you.
Is it possible to combine both? Let's try the following:

```bash
$ git log --patch forecast.md
```

You should get a long list of output, and you should be able to see both commit messages and
the difference between each commit.

Question: What does the following command do?

```bash
$ git log --patch HEAD~9 *.md
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- `git log` displays the repositories history.
- `git diff` displays differences between commits.
- `HEAD` references the last commit.
- `HEAD~1` references the commit before last.
