::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Configure `git` the first time it is used on a computer.
- Understand the meaning of the `--global` configuration flag.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How do I get set up to use Git?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When we use Git on a new computer for the first time,
we need to configure a few things. Below are a few examples
of configurations we will set as we get started with Git:

- our name and email address,
- what our preferred text editor is,
- and that we want to use these settings globally (i.e. for every project).

## Command Line Git Setup

On a command line, Git commands are written as `git verb options`,
where `verb` is what we actually want to do and `options` is additional optional information which may be needed for the `verb`.

### Authorship

To set up a new computer:

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "Joanne Simpson"
$ git config --global user.email "j.simpson@mo-weather.uk"
```

Please use your own name and email address.
This user name and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity,
which means that any changes pushed to
[GitHub](https://github.com/),
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/),
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or
another Git host server
after this lesson will include this information.

For this lesson, we will be interacting with [GitHub](https://github.com/) and so the email address used should be the same as the one used when setting up your GitHub account. If you are concerned about privacy, please review [GitHub's instructions for keeping your email address private][git-privacy].

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Keeping your email private

If you elect to use a private email address with GitHub, then use GitHub's no-reply email address for the `user.email` value.
Your `noreply` email address will end in `@users.noreply.github.com`.
You can look up your own address in your GitHub [email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails).
Check with your instructor whether your organisation has a policy on keeping emails private.
At the Met Office it is up to you whether to keep your email address private.

### Text Editor

To set your preferred text editor,
find the correct configuration command from this table:

| Editor                                | Configuration command |
| :-----------                          | :------------------------------ |
| Atom                                  | `$ git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"`                      |
| nano                                  | `$ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"`                      |
| BBEdit (Mac, with command line tools) | `$ git config --global core.editor "bbedit -w"`                      |
| Sublime Text (Mac)                    | `$ git config --global core.editor "/Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl -n -w"`                      |
| Sublime Text (Win, 32-bit install)    | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"`                      |
| Sublime Text (Win, 64-bit install)    | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"`                      |
| Notepad (Win)                         | `$ git config --global core.editor "c:/Windows/System32/notepad.exe"`                      |
| Notepad++ (Win, 32-bit install)       | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`                      |
| Notepad++ (Win, 64-bit install)       | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`                      |
| Kate (Linux)                          | `$ git config --global core.editor "kate"`                      |
| Gedit (Linux)                         | `$ git config --global core.editor "gedit --wait --new-window"`                      |
| Scratch (Linux)                       | `$ git config --global core.editor "scratch-text-editor"`                      |
| Emacs                                 | `$ git config --global core.editor "emacs"`                      |
| Vim                                   | `$ git config --global core.editor "vim"`                      |
| gVim                                  | `$ git config --global core.editor "gvim -f"`                      |
| VS Code                               | `$ git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`                      |

It is possible to reconfigure the text editor for Git whenever you want to change it.

::: caution

### Nedit not available on Azure Spice

Nedit won't be available on Azure SPICE VDI.
Details are available in the [Met Office Azure SPICE Documentation](https://wwwspice/docs/software/removed/?h=nedit).
The most similar editor in the table above is Gedit.

## Exiting Vim

Note that Vim is the default editor for many programs. If you haven't used Vim before and wish to exit a session without saving
your changes, press <kbd>Esc</kbd> then type `:q!` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>↵</kbd> or on Macs, <kbd>Return</kbd>.
If you want to save your changes and quit, press <kbd>Esc</kbd> then type `:wq` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>↵</kbd> or on Macs, <kbd>Return</kbd>.

### Default Branch Name

Git (2.28+) allows configuration of the name of the branch created when you
initialize any new repository. We want to set this to `main` so
it matches the cloud service we will eventually use.

```bash
$ git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## History of `main`

Source file changes are associated with a "branch".
By default, Git will create a branch called `master`
when you create a new repository with `git init` (as explained in the next Episode). This term evokes
the racist practice of human slavery and the
[software development community](https://github.com/github/renaming)  has moved to adopt
more inclusive language.

In 2020, most Git code hosting services transitioned to using `main` as the default
branch. As an example, any new repository that is opened in GitHub and GitLab default
to `main`.  However, Git has not yet made the same change.  As a result, local repositories
must be manually configured have the same main branch name as most cloud services.

For versions of Git prior to 2.28, the change can be made on an individual repository level.  The
command for this is in the next episode.  Note that if this value is unset in your local Git
configuration, the `init.defaultBranch` value defaults to `master`.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The five commands we just ran above only need to be run once: the flag `--global` tells Git
to use the settings for every project, in your user account, on this computer.

## Text Editor Git Setup

Let's review those settings and test our `core.editor` right away:

```bash
$ git config --global --edit
```

Let's close the file without making any additional changes.
Since typos in the config file will cause issues,
it's safer to view the configuration with:

```bash
$ git config --list
```

And alter the configuration via the command line.
You can re-run the commands above as many times as you want
to change your configuration.
The [discussion](../learners/discuss.md#more-advanced-git-configuration)
page has details on more recommended settings.

## Proxy

In some networks you need to use a
[proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server). If this is the case, you
may also need to tell Git about the proxy:

```bash
$ git config --global http.proxy proxy-url
$ git config --global https.proxy proxy-url
```

To disable the proxy, use

```bash
$ git config --global --unset http.proxy
$ git config --global --unset https.proxy
```

## Git Help and Manual

If you forget the subcommands or options of a `git` command, you can access the
relevant list of options typing `git <command> -h` or access the corresponding Git manual by typing
`git <command> --help`, e.g.:

```bash
$ git config -h
$ git config --help
```

While viewing the manual, remember the `:` is a prompt waiting for commands and you can press <kbd>Q</kbd> to exit the manual.

More generally, you can get the list of available `git` commands and further resources of the Git manual typing:

```bash
$ git help
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Use `git config` with the `--global` option to configure a user name, email address, editor, and other preferences once per machine.
